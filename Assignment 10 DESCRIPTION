Description: This package takes a CSV file that is independently generated by another fictional program and compares it to previous files, before constructing several graphs to visualize usage patterns. The files in question contain data representing usage metrics from a fictional library at the end of each business week. This allows for a quick way to measure weekly benchmarks for the library.
